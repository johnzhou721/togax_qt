A pretty much not working Toga Qt backend I'm starting.

I don't accept PRs here, however you're welcome to leave comments about the implementation by creating an issue (and probably commenting on other ones).

Currently I'm running by using testapp.py in the current directory without packaging, setting the `TOGA_BACKEND` environment variable appropriately, letting Python use the package in place.

ATTRIBUTION: Lots of code are copied from the official Toga project backends, authored by Dr. Russell Keith-Magee with contributors.

This backend currently has no license, so don't use it yet.  Once I get the stuff into the official project though it'd likely be under BSD 3-clause.
