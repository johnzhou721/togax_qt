A pretty much not working Toga Qt backend I'm starting.


Right now I'm to the point where F to C converter is up and running, so if you'd like to contribute a feature and fix some bugs, go right ahead and open a PR!

Leave more abstract discussions to the Toga issue on Qt: https://github.com/beeware/toga/issues/1142

Regarding behavior: follow the BeeWare Code of Conduct on the BeeWare Issue, obviously (https://beeware.org/community/behavior/code-of-conduct/, just to inform you of it if you're an
expert in Qt but haven't seen BeeWare yet), for this repo don't do stupid things here and you should be fine.

Currently I'm running by using testapp.py in the current directory without packaging, setting the `TOGA_BACKEND` environment variable appropriately, letting Python use the package in place.

ATTRIBUTION: Lots of code are copied from the official Toga project backends, authored by Dr. Russell Keith-Magee with contributors.
